# Wordle
Wordle provides users with a digital version of the Wordle game. Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. The website is designed to provide an enjoyable and interactive user experience. It presents the user with a blank set of letter slots representing the word to be guessed and provides feedback on the correctness of their guesses.

## Features
- Gameplay: Players can guess a five-letter word by submitting their guesses. The website provides feedback on each guess by highlighting correctly guessed letters (in green) and indicating letters that exist in the word but are not in the correct position (in yellow).
- Word Generation: The website generates a random five-letter word at the beginning of each game. The game is limited to a certain number of attempts, adding an element of challenge.
- Guess History: The website keeps track of the player's guess history, displaying the previous guesses and their corresponding feedback.
- Reset: Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round with a new random word.
